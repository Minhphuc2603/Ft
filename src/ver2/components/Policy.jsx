              <li>
                <strong>(a) Request access to your personal data:</strong> Commonly known as a “data subject access request,” this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to verify that we are lawfully processing it.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>(b) Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you:</strong> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

                <strong>(c) Request erasure of your personal data:</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us to continue processing it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.

              <li>
                <strong>(d) Object to processing of your personal data:</strong> This applies when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation that makes you want to object to processing on this ground, as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>(e) Request restriction of processing of your personal data:</strong> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  iii. Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or
                </li>
                <li>
                  iv. You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
                </li>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>(f) Request the transfer of your personal data:</strong> We will provide your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format to you or a third party you have chosen. Please note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>(g) Withdraw consent:</strong> You may withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

              Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
              <li>
                (a) We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.

              <li>
                (b) Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the UK which give personal data the same protection it has in the UK.

                Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK.
